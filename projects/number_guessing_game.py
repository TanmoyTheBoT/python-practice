# Number Guessing Game
# Write a program to have the computer randomly select a number between 1 and
# 100, and then prompt the player to guess the number. The program should give
# hints if the guess is too high or too low.

max_attempts = 10

# guess = 0

            print(f"Too high! remaining attempts {max_attempts - guesses}")
            # guesses += 1

        elif(guess < num):
            print(f"Too low! remaining attempts {max_attempts - guesses}")
            # guesses += 1
