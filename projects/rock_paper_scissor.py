# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
# Write a program to simulate a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
# The game will prompt the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors by typing 'r',
# 'p', or 's'. The computer will randomly select its choice. The game will then display
# both choices using emojis and determine the winner based on the rules

# rock     0      rock beats scissors
# paper    1      paper beats rock.
# scissors 2      scissors beat paper
